The taxa A. bornmuelleriana and A. equi-trojani are frequently considered to be synonymous with the latter as the accepted name, but there is evidence that they are distinct taxa. Handel-Mazzetti named them at the same time in 1925 from distinct geographical regions; therefore my classification here treating A. equi-trojani as a subordinate taxon follows the genetic data in Hrivnak et al. (2017) establishing it as a recent offshoot of A. bornmuelleriana. Coode and Cullen (1965) also considered these taxa to be distinct, and at the species level.
